# OCR POC Microservice using Google Cloud Vision API for Onerent's Renter Qualification
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This is a proof-of-concept that will showcase the probability of using google cloud vision
as a means to process documents so as the Leasing Department can have more time to handle
other tasks aside from checking the validity of documents.

### What should it do
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This is a service that will accept images and possibly PDFs and send the files for processing to
google cloud vision. There will be separation of document types to make sure that each document
will be processed accordingly to the type it was designated to be.

### Why do we need it
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This will help Onerent's leasing department in processing documents and making sure that the documents
are up to date and are "valid"
